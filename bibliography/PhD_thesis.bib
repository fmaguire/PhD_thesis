two different algal groups American NC64A
European (Pbi)
both are CHlorella sensu stricto 
Multiple origins - polyphyletic symbiont groups in chlorella 
Easily distinguishable using intronic insertions in rDNA

        

        
zoochlorella - general term for green corpuscules in protozoans/inverts with no taxonomic meaning

        

        
P gets photosynthate, C gets protection from prot and viruses and mobility to PS areas

        

        
Individual perialgal vacuoles continunously inherited rather than transient symbionts as part of phagocytosis like many protoxoa (Reisser Widowski 1992)

        

        
CHECK SIEGEL 1960 FOR INHERITANCE 

        

        
Algae-free P can reabsorb cultured C from green P, other prot or free-living C

        

        
C more diverse than originally believed

        

        
C ubiquitous 4-10um, minimal organells - nucleus, cp, mt, peroxi and vacuoles - no obvious morph chars - exclusively asexual via autosprulation

        

        
Early studies broke down Chrloella in 19 taxa including C based on temp, pH, NaCl, vit req, nitrate reduction, hydrogenase activity, generation of secondary cartenoids, cell wall sugar composistion, GC

        

        
Range of GC \% in chlorella suggests possible polyphyletic origin

        

        
P - originally called Z. conductrix by Beijernick in 1890 - Zooch lost taxonomic status - morph similarity to Chlorella sp and poor growth on nitrate it was called Chlorella (like vulgaris etc). Independent species C. parameciii in 1936 by Loefer. Shihara+Krauss rejected in 1965 - became C. variablis - no longer in use due to differences from type strains in CCAP (211/6) and UTEX (130) - symbionts are now known as unamed Chlorella sp. 

        

        
NC64A(M) is the true NC64A (in literature). 

        

        
American + European different - however generally no reason to distinguish symbiotic algael from free-living (evolved from them)

        

        
Morphologically no difference between free-living and symbiont even under EM

        

        
P symbionts are mooth-walled spheres (5-8um) lacking flagella that release four autospores. Single chloroplast - sacuer cup or girdle-shaped and the pyrenoid is typically penetrated by a thykaloid membrane. (American and European get different stains with ruthenium red).

        

        
Symbionts KEY physiological characteristics - maltose excretion (Brown and Nielsen 1974), requirement of thiamine and other vimatims and in some strains a reduced nitrogen source (Douglass+Huss, 1986, Kessler and Huss 1990; Reisser 1988b, Reisser+widowski 1992)

        

        
Hydrogenase was detected in some studies (NC64A or Pbi) but not others.

        

        
ALBERS 1982 physiologicla characteristics may change in culture.

        

        
Reisser 1998b reported low photosynthate secretion in NC64A - 4.17\% total fixation at pH4.8 (i.e. potentially perialgal pH). Freshly isolated F36-ZK released nearly half photosynthate at pH 5 (Kamako+Imamura 2006).
Longer cultured NC64 has reduced nitrate reductase activity - F36-ZK has none (Kamako et al 2005).

        

        
NC64A+American has one PBCV, Pbi+European have another. No cross-infection or to free-living.

abstract = {Treatment of symbiotic alga-bearing Paramecium bursaria cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, induces synchronous swelling of all perialgal vacuoles at about 24h after treatment under a constant light condition. Subsequently, the vacuoles detach from the host cell cortex. The algae in the vacuoles are digested by the host's lysosomal fusion to the vacuoles. To elucidate the timing of algal degeneration, P. bursaria cells were treated with cycloheximide under a constant light condition. Then the cells were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Results show that algal chloroplasts and nuclei degenerated within 9h after treatment, but before the synchronous swelling of the perialgal vacuole and appearance of acid phosphatase activity in the perialgal vacuole by lysosomal fusion. Treatment with cycloheximide under a constant dark condition and treatment with chloramphenicol under a constant light condition induced neither synchronous swelling of the vacuoles nor digestion of the algae inside the vacuoles. These results demonstrate that algal proteins synthesized during photosynthesis are necessary to maintain chloroplastic and nuclear structures, and that inhibition of protein synthesis induces rapid lysis of these organelles, after which synchronous swelling of the perialgal vacuole and fusion occur with the host lysosomes.},

@article{Guindon2010,
abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used (>2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

@article{Summerer2009,
abstract = {We assessed the photoprotective role of symbiotic Chlorella in the ciliate Paramecium bursaria by comparing their sensitivity to UV radiation (UVR) with Chlorella-reduced and Chlorella-free (aposymbiotic) cell lines of the same species. Aposymbiotic P. bursaria had significantly higher mortality than the symbiotic cell lines when exposed to UVR. To elucidate the protection mechanism, we assessed the algal distribution within the ciliate using thin-sections and transmission electron microscopy and estimated the screening factor by Chlorella based on an optical model. These analyses evidenced a substantial screening factor ranging, from 59.2\% to 93.2\% (320nm) for regular algal distribution. This screening efficiency reached up to approximately 100\% when Chlorella algae were dislocated to the posterior region of the ciliate. The dislocation was observed in symbiotic ciliates only under exposure to UV plus photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or to high PAR levels. Moreover, under exposure to UVB radiation and high PAR, symbiotic P. bursaria aggregated into dense spots. This behavior could represent an efficient avoidance strategy not yet described for ciliates. Analyses of the intact symbiosis and their algal symbionts for UV-screening compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids and sporopollenin) proved negative. Overall, our results show that photoprotection in this ciliate symbiosis represents an additional advantage to the hitherto postulated nutritional benefits.},

abstract = {A green ciliate Paramecium bursaria, bearing several hundreds of endosymbiotic algae, demonstrates rotational microtubule-based cytoplasmic streaming, in which cytoplasmic granules and endosymbiotic algae flow in a constant direction. However, its physiological significance is still unknown. We investigated physiological roles of cytoplasmic streaming in P. bursaria through host cell cycle using video-microscopy. Here, we found that cytoplasmic streaming was arrested in dividing green paramecia and the endosymbiotic algae proliferated only during the arrest of cytoplasmic streaming. Interestingly, arrest of cytoplasmic streaming with pressure or a microtubule drug also induced proliferation of endosymbiotic algae independently of host cell cycle. Thus, cytoplasmic streaming may control the algal proliferation in P. bursaria. Furthermore, confocal microscopic observation revealed that a division septum was formed in the constricted area of a dividing paramecium, producing arrest of cytoplasmic streaming. This is a first report to suggest that cytoplasmic streaming controls proliferation of eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the "CAT" approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100-1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

abstract = {Chlorella variabilis NC64A, a unicellular photosynthetic green alga (Trebouxiophyceae), is an intracellular photobiont of Paramecium bursaria and a model system for studying virus/algal interactions. We sequenced its 46-Mb nuclear genome, revealing an expansion of protein families that could have participated in adaptation to symbiosis. NC64A exhibits variations in GC content across its genome that correlate with global expression level, average intron size, and codon usage bias. Although Chlorella species have been assumed to be asexual and nonmotile, the NC64A genome encodes all the known meiosis-specific proteins and a subset of proteins found in flagella. We hypothesize that Chlorella might have retained a flagella-derived structure that could be involved in sexual reproduction. Furthermore, a survey of phytohormone pathways in chlorophyte algae identified algal orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling, suggesting that these functions were established prior to the evolution of land plants. We show that the ability of Chlorella to produce chitinous cell walls likely resulted from the capture of metabolic genes by horizontal gene transfer from algal viruses, prokaryotes, or fungi. Analysis of the NC64A genome substantially advances our understanding of the green lineage evolution, including the genomic interplay with viruses and symbiosis between eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the "multiple segment Viterbi" (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

abstract = {Paramecium bursaria (green paramecium) possesses endosymbiotically growing chlorella-like green algae. An aposymbiotic cell line of P. bursaria (MBw-1) was prepared from the green MB-1 strain with the herbicide paraquat. The SA-2 clone of symbiotic algae was employed to reinfect MBw-1 cells and thus a regreened cell line (MBr-1) was obtained. The regreened paramecia were used to study the impact of the host's growth status on the life cycle of the symbiotic algae. Firstly, the relationship between the timing of algal propagation and the host cell division was investigated by counting the algal cells in single host cells during and after the host cell division and also in the stationary phase. Secondly, the changes in the endogenous chlorophyll level, DNA content, and cell size in the symbiotic algae were monitored by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The number of algae was shown to be doubled prior to or during the host cell division and the algal population in the two daughter cells is maintained at constant level until the host cell cycle reenters the cytokinesis, suggesting that algal propagation and cell cycle are dependent on the host's cell cycle. During the host's stationary growth, unicellular algal vegetatives with low chlorophyll content were dominant. In contrast, complexes of algal cells called sporangia (containing 1-4 autospores) were present in the logarithmically growing hosts, indicating that algal cell division leading to the formation of sporangia with multiple autospores is active in the dividing paramecia.},

Although assembling a new genome can still be costly and difficult, it is possible to use RNA-seq to sequence mRNA. In the absence of a known genome, it is necessary to assemble these sequences de novo, taking into account possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values. RESULTS: We present a software package named Oases designed to heuristically assemble RNA-seq reads in the absence of a reference genome, across a broad spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms. It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse RNA-seq data and is shown to improve significantly on the transABySS and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.

abstract = {Many ciliates acquire the capacity for photosynthesis through stealing plastids or harboring intact endosymbiotic algae. Both phenomena are a form of mixotrophy and are widespread among ciliates. Mixotrophic ciliates may be abundant in freshwater and marine ecosystems, sometimes making substantial contributions toward community primary productivity. While mixotrophic ciliates utilize phagotrophy to capture algal cells, their endomembrane system has evolved to partially bypass typical heterotrophic digestion pathways, enabling metabolic interaction with foreign cells or organelles. Unique adaptations may also be found in certain algal endosymbionts, facilitating establishment of symbiosis and nutritional interactions, while reducing their fitness for survival as free-living cells. Plastid retaining oligotrich ciliates possess little selectivity from which algae they sequester plastids, resulting in unstable kleptoplastids that require frequent ingestion of algal cells to replace them. Mesodinium rubrum (=Myrionecta rubra) possesses cryptophyte organelles that resemble a reduced endosymbont, and is the only ciliate capable of functional phototrophy and plastid division. Certain strains of M. rubrum may have a stable association with their cryptophyte organelles, while others need to acquire a cryptophyte nucleus through feeding. This process of stealing a nucleus, termed karyoklepty, was first described in M. rubrum and may be an evolutionary precursor to a stable, reduced endosymbiont, and perhaps eventually a tertiary plastid. The newly described Mesodinium"chamaeleon," however, is less selective of which cryptophyte species it will retain organelles, and appears less capable of sustained phototrophy. Ciliates likely stem from a phototrophic ancestry, which may explain their propensity to practice acquired phototrophy.},

abstract = {Each symbiotic Chlorella of the ciliate Paramecium bursaria is enclosed in a perialgal vacuole membrane derived from the host digestive vacuole membrane. Alga-free paramecia and symbiotic algae can grow independently. Mixing them experimentally can cause reinfection. Earlier, we reported that the symbiotic algae appear to push the host trichocysts aside to become fixed beneath the host cell cortex during the algal reinfection process. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with a monoclonal antibody against the trichocysts demonstrates that the trichocysts change their locality to form algal attachment sites and decrease their density beneath the host cell cortex through algal reinfection. Transmission electron microscopy to detect acid phosphatase activity showed that some trichocysts near the host cell cortex are digested by the host lysosomal fusion during algal reinfection. Removal of algae from the host cell using cycloheximide recovers the trichocyst's arrangement and number near the host cell cortex. These results indicate that symbiotic algae compete for their attachment sites with preexisting trichocysts and that the algae have the ability to ensure algal attachment sites beneath the host cell cortex.},

abstract = {We describe and validate a new membrane protein topology prediction method, TMHMM, based on a hidden Markov model. We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98 \% of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 \%, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 \% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. A TMHMM prediction service is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.},

abstract = {Cells of the ciliate Paramecium bursaria harbor symbiotic Chlorella spp. in their cytoplasm. To establish endosymbiosis with alga-free P. bursaria, symbiotic algae must leave the digestive vacuole (DV) to appear in the cytoplasm by budding of the DV membrane. This budding was induced not only by intact algae but also by boiled or fixed algae. However, this budding was not induced when food bacteria or India ink were ingested into the DVs. These results raise the possibility that P. bursaria can recognize sizes of the contents in the DVs. To elucidate this possibility, microbeads with various diameters were mixed with alga-free P. bursaria and traced their fate. Microbeads with 0.20$\mu$m diameter did not induce budding of the DVs. Microbeads with 0.80$\mu$m diameter produced DVs of 5-10$\mu$m diameter at 3min after mixing; then the DVs fragmented and became vacuoles of 2-5$\mu$m diameter until 3h after mixing. Each microbead with a diameter larger than 3.00$\mu$m induced budding similarly to symbiotic Chlorella. These observations reveal that induction of DV budding depends on the size of the contents in the DVs. Dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor, greatly inhibited DV budding, suggesting that dynamin might be involved in DV budding.},

Virus particles were abundant and localized in the ciliary pits of the cortex and in the buccal cavity of P. bursaria. This was shown for two types of the symbiotic systems associated with two types of Chlorella viruses - Pbi or NC64A. A novel quantitative stereological approach was applied to test whether virus particles were distributed randomly on the Paramecium surface or preferentially occupied certain zones. The ability of the virus to form an association with the ciliate was investigated experimentally; virus particles were mixed with P. bursaria or with symbiont-free species P. caudatum. Our results confirmed that in the freshwater ecosystems two types of P. bursaria -Chlorella symbiotic systems exist, those without Chlorella viruses and those associated with a large amount of the viruses. The fate of Chlorella virus particles at the Paramecium surface was determined based on obtained statistical data and taking into account ciliate feeding currents and cortical reorganization during cell division. A life cycle of the viruses in the complete symbiotic system is proposed.},

abstract = {Planktonic flagellates and ciliates are the major consumers of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in aquatic environments, playing a pivotal role in carbon cycling and nutrient regeneration. Despite certain unicellular predators using chemosensory responses to locate and select their prey, the biochemical mechanisms behind prey reception and selection have not been elucidated. Here we identify a Ca(2+)-dependent, mannose-binding lectin on the marine dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina, which is used as a feeding receptor for recognizing prey. Blocking the receptor using 20 microM mannose-BSA inhibited ingestion of phytoplankton prey, Isochrysis galbana, by 60\%. In prey selection studies, O. marina ingested twice as many 6 mum diameter beads coated with mannose-BSA as those coated with galNac-BSA. When pre-incubated with mannose-BSA, O. marina was no longer able to discriminate between different sugar-coated beads. Thus, these findings reveal molecular mechanisms of protozoan prey recognition. Our results also indicate the functional similarity between cellular recognition used by planktonic protozoa to discriminate between different prey items, and those used by metazoan phagocytic blood cells to recognize invading microorganisms.},

abstract = {Paramecium species are extremely valuable organisms to enable experiments for the reestablishment of endosymbiosis. This is investigated in two different systems, the first with Paramecium caudatum and the endonuclear symbiotic bacterium Holospora species. Although most endosymbiotic bacteria cannot grow outside the host cell as a result of their reduced genome size, Holospora species can maintain their infectivity for a limited time. We found that an 89-kDa periplasmic protein has an important function for Holospora's invasion into the target nucleus, and that Holospora alters the host gene expression; the host thereby acquires resistance against various stresses. The second system is the symbiosis between P. bursaria and symbiotic Chlorella. Alga-free P. bursaria and the algae retain the ability to grow without a partner. Consequently, endosymbiosis between the aposymbiotic host cells and the symbiotic algae can be reestablished easily by mixing them. We now found four checkpoints for the reestablishment of the endosymbiosis between P. bursaria and the algae. The findings in the two systems provide excellent opportunities for us to elucidate not only infection processes but also to assess the associations leading to eukaryotic cell evolution. This paper summarizes recent progresses on reestablishment of the primary and the secondary endosymbiosis in Paramecium.},

Permanent symbiosis, however, seems to be restricted to Chlorella taxa. To test the specificity of this association, we designed infection experiments with two aposymbiotic P. bursaria strains and Chlorella symbionts isolated from four Paramecium strains, seven other ciliate hosts and two Hydra strains, as well as three free-living Chlorella species. Paramecium bursaria established stable symbioses with all tested Chlorella symbionts of ciliates, but never with symbiotic Chlorella of Hydra viridissima or with free-living Chlorella. Furthermore, we tested the infection specificity of P. bursaria with a 1:1:1 mixture of three compatible Chlorella strains, including the native symbiont, and then identified the strain of the newly established symbiosis by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region 1 of the 18S rRNA gene. The results indicated that P. bursaria established symbiosis with its native symbiont. We conclude that despite clear preferences for their native Chlorella, the host-symbiont relationship in P. bursaria is flexible.},

@article{Sonnhammer1998,
abstract = {A novel method to model and predict the location and orientation of alpha helices in membrane-spanning proteins is presented. It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an architecture that corresponds closely to the biological system. The model is cyclic with 7 types of states for helix core, helix caps on either side, loop on the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the non-cytoplasmic side, and a globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The two loop paths on the non-cytoplasmic side are used to model short and long loops separately, which corresponds biologically to the two known different membrane insertions mechanisms. The close mapping between the biological and computational states allows us to infer which parts of the model architecture are important to capture the information that encodes the membrane topology, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and constraints involved. Models were estimated both by maximum likelihood and a discriminative method, and a method for reassignment of the membrane helix boundaries were developed. In a cross validated test on single sequences, our transmembrane HMM, TMHMM, correctly predicts the entire topology for 77\% of the sequences in a standard dataset of 83 proteins with known topology. The same accuracy was achieved on a larger dataset of 160 proteins. These results compare favourably with existing methods.},

@article{Kodama2007a,
abstract = {Paramecium bursaria free of symbiotic Chlorella species can be experimentally reinfected with algae isolated from algae-bearing cells by ingestion into digestive vacuoles. Isolated symbiotic algae were cloned, mixed with the algae-free P. bursaria at 25 +/- 1 degrees C for 1.5 min, washed and chased, with or without fixation 3 h after mixing. Though genetically identical, a few of the algae were not digested but coexisted with the digested ones in the same vacuole after lysosomal fusion. Light microscopy showed that algal fate did not depend on cell cycle stage or location in the vacuole. Electron microscopy showed that the nondigested algae were not protected by a perialgal vacuole membrane in the digestive vacuole. Moreover, this phenomenon was also observed in the presence of cycloheximide and puromycin, which are known to inhibit algal and host protein synthesis, respectively. These observations suggest that a few algae can acquire temporary resistance to host lysosomal enzymes in order to establish endosymbiosis without algal protein synthesis.},
