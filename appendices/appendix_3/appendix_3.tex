This thesis was typeset using \XeLaTeX\ via the text editor \texttt{vim}.
The class file used was modified by me from the official UCL \LaTeX\ thesis template 
\texttt{ucl-thesis.cls} written by Ian Kirker. Compilation was managed using
\texttt{latexmk} and a \texttt{makefile}.

References were managed using \texttt{Mendeley} and typeset using \texttt{bib}{\TeX}.
Most figures were tweaked using \texttt{inkscape} and \texttt{gimp}.
All work was version controlled using \texttt{git} and uploaded to \texttt{github}.
