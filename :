\chapter{Conclusions and Recommendations}

There were 3 main objectives to this research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assessing the utility
of \textit{P. bursaria} and its endosymbioses with green algae
as a model organism for the study of the evolution of endosymbiosis.
    \item Generation of ``omic'' resources to inform further analysis of this system
    \item Investigating the the utility and feasibility 
            of current MDA-based
            single cell genomic and transcriptomic sequencing technique in the 
            analysis of complex multimember single-celled eukaryotic systems.
\end{itemize}

%Endosymbiosis is widespread across the tree of life and is a fundamental
%process in the evolution of the eukaryotes.   Unfortunately,
%it is difficult to study the evolution of this process as host
%and endosymbiont have developed obligate metabolic co-dependence.
%This means hypotheses about the mechanism of the endosymbiosis
%cannot be tested easily.  

Review of literature established that \textit{Paramecium bursaria} and its
4 algal endosymbionts: \textit{Chlorella variabilis}, \textit{Chlorella vulgaris},
and \textit{Micractinium reisseri} make theoretically good model
organisms for the study of this process due to the existence
of extensive.   This is due to them being believed to share:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a well-developed background literature.
    \item facultative endosymbioses allowing elimination of the endosymbiont
        and re-introduction experiments.
    \item the potential of a functional and tractable RNAi system for hypothesis
        testing.
    \item easily culturable and diverse available cultures.
\end{itemize}
However, with the exception of one transcriptomic analysis \citep{Kodama2014} 
there have been no analyses of these systems using 
contemporary transcriptomic, metabolomic or genomic techniques. 



%and the \textit{C. variabilis}
%NC64A and \textit{Coccomyxa subellipsoidea}

An investigation of elimination of the endosymbiont in the \textit{P. bursaria}
-\textit{M. reisseri} culture revealed that this endosymbiosis
may represent an obligate system, at least on the part of the
\textit{P. bursaria} SW1 host.  Even though 3 elimination methods and
a range of treatment concentrationst were attempted to minimise the 
risk that the host death was related a particular susceptability to a 
certain treatment all methods resulted in the same eventual host death.
Future work is required to establish whether \textit{M. reisseri}
algae are also obligate endosymbionts.  If this mutually obligate system is 
the case then metabolic co-dependence may have become fixed between
\textit{P. bursaria} and \textit{M. reisseri}.
Testing this could be achieved
by exploiting relative robustness of the chitinous cell wall
of the algae relative to the \textit{Paramecium} membrane. 
Although, care would be needed to discover the optimal culture conditions
as these algae are known to be relatively fastidious.











Despite using several elimination methods
and thus minimising the risk of a treatment being particularly
toxic in \textit{P. bursaria}








attempted


the host was observed to die shortly after the loss of the majority
of its \textit{M. reisseri} endosymbionts.










In the first results chapter an analysis of the diversity
of the algal endosymbionts established the mislabelling
of CCAP1660/13 culture as \textit{Coccomyxa}.




Furthermore, this analysis established that 
the photobionts in the CCAP 1660/12, CCAP 1660/13
and NBDJ Yad1g1N cultures most likely form
single photobiont cultures.  



This suggests that clonal photobiont populations
both exist in natural samples
and that there is little divergence of 


Unfortunately, the suitability of 

with the emergence of such large differences between 
the endosymbiotic traits in different \textit{P. bursaria}-algal
pairs as well as the general taxonomic turmoil and issues
with mislabelling of cultures the existing literature
particularly pre-1990s and the solid establishment of
modern sequencing based taxonomic evaluations.


This also potentially explains the differences in preferences
displayed by \textit{P. bursaria} for its specific endosymbiont.







Finally, the \textit{Micractinium reisseri} endosymbiont in cultures CCAP 1660/12 
CCAP 1660/13 has potentially become metabolically co-dependent with the host.
The host appears incapable of survival without the endosymbiont, therefore,
it is important to attempt to identify the differences between the demonstrably
facultative relationship between the Japanese Yad1g1N strains (used in \citep{Kodama2014c}) 
and the putatively obligate CCAP 1660/12. Identifying these differences may pinpoint
the mechanism by which metabolic co-dependence becomes fixed in \textit{P. bursaria}
- green algal endosymbioses.






This was expected for the Yad1g1N due to the 
way this culture was prepared. However, 
it was useful to establish this for CCAP 1660/12
as this culture was naturally sampled.

Despite earlier findings that


This began the revelation of considerable host-endosymbiont
diversity between the 4 groups of \textit{Paramecium bursaria}
green algal endosymbionts. 





Chapter 5 implicates different systems, again reinforcing
the finding in Chapter 3 that there is considerably
diversity to the endosymbioses.





Chapter 6 The presence of RNAi systems is consistent across 
at least two \textit{P. bursaria} systems.

of the eukaryotic cell as well as specific mechanistic

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Why not further integration?}

Why is there not evidence of tighter integration in this system.

Firstly, the protein import systems considered necessary for extensive
EGT to start taking place are complicated
in the cases of secondary and tertiary endosymbioses
than basic plsatids due to the increased number
of membranes that may need to be traversed especially
for import directly to the secondary plastid from the
host \citep{Hirakawa2012}.


Secondly, the unusual nuclear dimorphism of the host \textit{P. bursaria}
may prove a barrier to the vast majority of EGT activity. 

For successful transfer to take place between host and endosymbiont it
would be necessary for the gene to transfer not just from the 
endosymbiont to the transcriptionally active host MAC but to the germline
MIC.  Even then integration into the MIC would have to occur in such a way
that it would be correctly spliced and duplicated during the conversion of the MIC
back to the MAC.
Compounding this with sexual reproduction further decreases the probability of
effective integration.

It should be noted that the prototypical hosts of the endosymbiotically ``promiscuous''
green algae - \textit{Chlorella}, \textit{Coccomyxa} and \textit{Micractinium} 
all display germline sequestration either through the aforementioned dimorphism
in \textit{P. bursaria} or via standard metazoan germlines in the case of
\textit{Hydra} and the kleptoplastic sacoglossan sea slugs. 






\subsection{What is not expressed during endosymbiosis?}

This is another source of further work that 

partially addressed by kodama


We could take, or improve the genomic assembly, annotate and identify
all genes present in this assembly 
and then survey the transcriptomes for their presence.

Any gene annotated in the genomic contigs that is not expressed
have a significant role in the function of the endosymbiosis



Survey \textit{Coccomyxa} and \textit{C. variabilis} NC64A.
