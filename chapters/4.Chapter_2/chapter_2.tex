\chapter{Identification of Transcript Origin}

Can you separate transcripts from host, endosymbiont and food bacteria?

Current practices and how they were applied - BLAST, GC etc

Initial binning vs phylogenetics - seems better

But still too work intensive - use manually done 10,000 for rest of transcriptome therefore ML

Flowchart of tool 

t-SNE plot of vectors

classifier log-loss and learning curve comparison using logistic regression, SVM with diff kernels

Convergence check for SVM hyperparameters

anomaly detection?
