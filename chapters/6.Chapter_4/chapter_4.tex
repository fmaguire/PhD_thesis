In biology, nothing is clear, everything is too complicated, everything is a mess, 
and just when you think you understand something, you peel off a layer and find 
deeper complications beneath. Nature is anything but simple.

\chapter{RNAi Analyses}


\section{Introduction}

RNAi is a highly useful experimental methodology through which
many biological hypotheses can be tested.





\subsection{RNAi pathway in \textit{Paramecium} sp.}

Is there significant cross-talk between endosymbiont and host? - is this why RNAi doesn't seem to work

What of the required RNAi components from Marker are present in genome and transcriptome host bins

What is the phylogeny of these components compared to other Paramecium/ciliate species?

eDicer experiment results - what is the overlap with host orthologs of known yeast lethal genes

rnai as cross-kingdom communication \citep{Weiberg2015}

\section{Aims}

Induce RNAi based knock-down using transformed bacterial vectors.

RNAi via microinjection

Identify required components for endogenous or exogenous RNAi in \textit{P. bursaria} CCAP 1660/12 from transcriptome and genome

Investigate the possiblity of "host" - "endosymbiont" collision as a reason for disabling.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Exogenous RNAi is non-functional in \textit{P. bursaria} CCAP 1660/12}



\subsection{Endogenous RNAi is methodologically difficult}


While RNAi by microinjection repeatedly failed there is a still a high possibility
that this is more related to the methodological difficulty of this technique rather than
necessarily any
