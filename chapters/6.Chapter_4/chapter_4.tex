\chapter{Endosymbiont Metabolic Analysis}

What is the endosymbiont doing? - metabolic map

How does it differ between day and night? - differential expression

What does it need?

What is it secreting? (control against NC64A chlorella signal peptides - are we missing anything obvious in transcriptome endosymbiont bin)

DUE DATE: END OF JUNE


UBLAST and cut-off for KO annotation, IPATH2.0 for maps  \citep{Wisecaver2014}




Also of interest is the activity of fatty acid and amino acid biosynthesis in the endosymbiont.  This is because
all well studied examples of primary of secondary plastids that have lost photosynthetic activity appear to maintain 
essential roles in these and other areas of host metabolism.
In all well-studied cases to date, the plastid itself is retained, as it is known to be the site of essential biochemical processes unrelated to photosynthesis, including fatty acid and amino acid biosynthesis (Waller and McFadden 2005; Barbrook et al. 2006; Mazumdar et al. 2006). \citep{Donaher2009}



Additionally the comparison of photosynthetic \textit{Symbodinium} within their cindarian hosts in both autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions
is of interest \citep{Xiang2015}


Genes indeitnfied in paramecium tetaurelia involve din autogamy, reciliation and exocytosis respectively \citep{Arnaiz2010}
Interestingly highly differentially expressed genes appear to have a lower rate of gene loss \citep{Arnaiz2010}




Diffeq - single cell - technical noise important - must be quantifeid so it can be incorporated into 

Low amount of RNA in single cell presents a major difficulity leading to unavoiable technicla noise \citep{Brennecke2013}
