\chapter{RNAi Analyses}

Is there significant cross-talk between endosymbiont and host? - is this why RNAi doesn't seem to work

What of the required RNAi components from Marker are present in genome and transcriptome host bins

What is the phylogeny of these components compared to other Paramecium/ciliate species?

eDicer experiment results - what is the overlap with host orthologs of known yeast lethal genes
