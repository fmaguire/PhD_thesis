% Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank Thomas Richards for his extensive guidance and support 
as my principal supervisor during this PhD. Not many supervisors
would allow such freedom to pursue diverse avenues of learning and
resarch even when those avenues might have been at odds with the research 
in question.

Secondly, I'd like to acknowledge Gavin Gray 
for his constant end-to-end encrypted presence, provision of chip-tunes,
proof-reading services, and distraction with machine learning side-projects.  


Mostly, I'd like to acknowledge coffee, for without its warming caffeinated embrace
none of this work would have been achieved.  


Aurelie Chambouvet and Adam Monier provided frequent 
``Auld Alliance'' coffee breaks 


I'd also like to thank Sarah Gurr for both accepting my application and encouraging
my interests throughout my undergraduate degree and as the puppetmaster that 
masterminded my eventual post-graduate studies.






``Camper Coffee'' for providing the coffee! 


Guy Leonard for advice and guidance in my first forays into bioinformatics. 
David Milner for his considerable contributions to the lab work in this thesis.
Theresa Hudson and Ines Yang for help in the culturing and maintenance of 
\textit{Paramecium bursaria} cultures. 

Finally, but by no means least, thanks go to my parents for their sustained
support throughout my academic career and life so far.
