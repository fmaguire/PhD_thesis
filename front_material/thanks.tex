% Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank Thomas Richards for his extensive guidance and support 
during this PhD. Not many supervisors
would allow such freedom to pursue diverse avenues of learning and
research even when those avenues might have been at odds with the research 
in question.

Secondly, I'd like to thank Gavin Gray 
for his constant end-to-end encrypted presence, provision of chip-tunes,
proof-reading services, and distraction with machine learning side-projects.  

Coffee, and its excellent providers at ``Camper Coffee''
has played a significant role in the completion of this thesis.
I'd also like to thank Aur\'elie Chambouvet and Adam Monier for their
frequent company on coffee forays. 

Sarah Gurr for both accepting my application and encouraging
my interests throughout my undergraduate degree and as the puppetmaster that 
masterminded my eventual post-graduate studies.

Guy Leonard for advice and guidance in my first forays into bioinformatics. 
David Milner for his considerable contributions to the lab work in this thesis.
Theresa Hudson and Ines Yang for help in the culturing and maintenance of 
\textit{Paramecium bursaria} cultures. 

Finally, but by no means least, thanks to my parents for their sustained
support throughout my academic career and life so far.
